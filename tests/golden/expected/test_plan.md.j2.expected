# Test Plan: Golden Test Spec

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Generated:** 2024-01-01T12:00:00Z
**Template:** balanced-1.0.0

## Test Strategy Overview

This test plan defines the testing approach for Golden Test Spec, covering behavioral scenarios, contract testing, and performance validation.

## Behavioral (BDD) Tests


### Default Scenarios

```gherkin
Feature: Core Functionality
  
  Scenario: Basic operation
    Given a valid system state
    When user performs core operation
    Then system responds within SLA
    And data integrity is maintained
```


## Contract Testing


### API Contracts
- Input validation and schema compliance
- Output format and data structure verification
- Error handling and status codes


## Property-Based Testing


### Core Properties
- Data consistency across operations
- Idempotency of safe operations
- Input sanitization and validation


## Performance Testing

### Performance Budgets

- Response time: < 2 seconds (95th percentile)
- Throughput: > 100 requests/second
- Memory usage: < 512MB peak


### Load Testing Scenarios
- Normal load: Expected user concurrency
- Peak load: 2x normal load capacity
- Stress testing: Breaking point identification

## Quality Gates

### Acceptance Criteria

- Code coverage > 80%
- No critical security vulnerabilities
- Performance within defined budgets

### Mutation Testing

- Mutation score target: 75%


## Test Execution Matrix

| Test Type | Coverage | Tools | Frequency |
|-----------|----------|--------|-----------|
| Unit Tests | Individual components | pytest/jest | Every commit |
| Integration | Component interactions | TestContainers | Every PR |
| BDD | User journeys | Cucumber/Behave | Release candidate |
| Performance | Load/stress | Artillery/k6 | Weekly |
| Contract | API compliance | Pact/OpenAPI | Every deployment |

## Success Metrics



### Quality Metrics
- Test pass rate: 100%
- Build success rate: > 95%
- Defect escape rate: < 5%

## Risk Mitigation


### General Risks
- Integration complexity: Addressed through contract testing
- Performance degradation: Continuous monitoring and benchmarks
- Data corruption: Property-based testing and validation
