# Project Idea: Smart Task Manager

## Problem Statement
Many knowledge workers struggle with task overwhelm and context switching, leading to decreased productivity and increased stress. Current task management tools are either too simple (basic to-do lists) or too complex (enterprise project management suites), lacking the right balance for individual productivity.

## Target Audience
- **Primary**: Individual knowledge workers (developers, designers, analysts, consultants)
- **Secondary**: Small teams (2-5 people) in creative and technical fields
- **Use Context**: Daily task management, project tracking, workflow optimization

## Value Proposition
- **Intelligent Prioritization**: AI-powered task ranking based on deadlines, dependencies, and user patterns
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains work context when switching between tasks
- **Seamless Integration**: Works with existing tools (calendar, email, code repos)
- **Adaptive Interface**: UI complexity adjusts to user expertise and current workload

## Non-Goals
- Enterprise project management
- Team collaboration features (initially)
- Time tracking and billing
- Complex reporting and analytics
- Mobile-first design (desktop focus initially)

## Success Metrics
- **User Engagement**: 80% daily active usage rate within 30 days
- **Task Completion**: 25% improvement in task completion rates
- **User Satisfaction**: NPS score >50 within 6 months
- **Context Switch Reduction**: 40% fewer context switches per day
