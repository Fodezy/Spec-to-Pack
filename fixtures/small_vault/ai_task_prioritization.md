# AI-Powered Task Prioritization

## Machine Learning Approaches
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Learn from similar user patterns
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Analyze task characteristics
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Adapt based on completion feedback

## Data Sources for Prioritization
- Historical completion patterns
- Calendar integration (deadlines, meetings)
- Email urgency indicators
- Project dependencies and blockers

## Implementation Considerations
- Privacy-preserving ML models
- Explainable AI for user trust
- Gradual learning and adaptation
