- Keyboard navigation testing

#### Manual Testing
- Screen reader testing (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- Keyboard-only navigation
- High contrast mode testing
- Zoom testing up to 200%

#### User Testing
- Testing with users with disabilities
- Feedback collection and iteration
- Usability studies with assistive technologies

## Testing Procedures

### Automated Testing Tools
```bash
# axe-core for accessibility scanning
npm install @axe-core/playwright

# Pa11y for command-line testing
npm install pa11y

# Color contrast analyzer
npm install color-contrast-analyser
```

### Screen Reader Testing

2. **JAWS (Windows)** - Test with current version
3. **VoiceOver (macOS)** - Test with Safari
4. **TalkBack (Android)** - Mobile testing
5. **VoiceOver (iOS)** - Mobile testing

### Keyboard Testing Scenarios
1. Tab through all interactive elements
2. Use arrow keys for custom controls
3. Test escape key functionality
4. Verify Enter and Space key actions
5. Test skip navigation links

### Mobile Accessibility Testing
