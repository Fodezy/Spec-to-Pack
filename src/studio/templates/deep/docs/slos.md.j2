## Overview

Service Level Objectives (SLOs) define the target level of reliability and performance for {{ meta.name }}.

{{ problem.statement }}

## SLO Framework

### Service Level Indicators (SLIs)
Quantitative measures of service behavior

### Service Level Objectives (SLOs)
Target values for SLIs over a period

### Service Level Agreements (SLAs)
External commitments based on SLOs with penalties

### Error Budgets
Amount of unreliability allowed (100% - SLO%)

## Core SLOs

### 1. Availability SLO
**Definition**: Percentage of successful requests over time

**SLI Measurement**:
```
Availability = (Successful Requests / Total Requests) × 100%
```

**Target**: 99.9% (8.76 hours downtime per year)

**Time Window**: 30 days

**Error Budget**: 0.1% = 43.2 minutes per month

**Measurement Method**:
- HTTP status codes 2xx, 3xx = Success
- HTTP status codes 4xx, 5xx = Failure
- Network timeouts = Failure

---

### 2. Latency SLO
**Definition**: Response time for user-facing requests

**SLI Measurement**:
```
Latency = Time from request start to response completion
```

**Targets**:
- **P90**: < 500ms (90% of requests faster than 500ms)
- **P99**: < 2000ms (99% of requests faster than 2s)

**Time Window**: 7 days

**Error Budget**: 
- P90: 10% of requests may exceed 500ms
- P99: 1% of requests may exceed 2000ms

**Measurement Method**:
- End-to-end request timing
- Exclude requests > 30s (timeouts)
- Measure at load balancer level

---

### 3. Error Rate SLO
**Definition**: Percentage of requests resulting in errors

**SLI Measurement**:
```
Error Rate = (Failed Requests / Total Requests) × 100%
```

**Target**: < 0.5%

**Time Window**: 24 hours

**Error Budget**: 0.5% of all requests may fail

**Error Classification**:
- **User Errors (4xx)**: Not counted against SLO
- **System Errors (5xx)**: Counted against SLO
- **Timeouts**: Counted against SLO

---

### 4. Throughput SLO
**Definition**: System capacity to handle request volume

**SLI Measurement**:
```
Throughput = Requests processed per second
```

**Target**: Support up to 1,000 RPS

**Time Window**: Peak hours (9 AM - 6 PM local time)

**Measurement Method**:
- Successful request processing rate
- Measured at application level
- Averaged over 1-minute intervals

---

## Feature-Specific SLOs

### Authentication Service
**Availability**: 99.95%
**Latency**: P99 < 1000ms
**Error Rate**: < 0.1%

Critical because auth failures block all user access.

### Payment Processing
**Availability**: 99.9%
**Latency**: P95 < 3000ms
**Error Rate**: < 0.2%

Higher latency tolerance due to external payment provider dependencies.

### Content Delivery
**Availability**: 99.5%
**Latency**: P90 < 200ms
**Error Rate**: < 1%

Uses CDN with multiple fallbacks, more tolerance acceptable.

### Background Jobs
**Processing Time**: 95% of jobs complete within 1 hour
**Failure Rate**: < 2%
**Backlog**: No job queue > 1000 items

## SLO Measurement & Monitoring

### Data Sources
```yaml
Primary Metrics Source:
  - Application Performance Monitoring (APM)
  - Load Balancer logs
  - Application logs
  - Synthetic monitoring

Secondary Sources:
  - User experience monitoring
  - Third-party monitoring services
  - Customer support metrics
```

### Dashboards
- **Executive Dashboard**: High-level SLO status
- **Operations Dashboard**: Detailed SLI trends
- **Error Budget Dashboard**: Burn rate and remaining budget

### Alerting Thresholds
```yaml
Error Budget Burn Alerts:
  - 10% budget consumed in 1 hour: Page immediately
  - 25% budget consumed in 6 hours: Alert team
  - 50% budget consumed in 24 hours: Warning
  
SLI Threshold Alerts:
  - Availability < 99%: Page immediately
  - P99 latency > 5s: Page immediately  
  - Error rate > 5%: Page immediately
```

## Error Budget Policy

### Budget Allocation
**Monthly Error Budget**: Based on 99.9% availability
- Total minutes: 43,200
- Error budget: 43.2 minutes

### Budget Burn Rate
- **Fast burn** (> 10% in 1 hour): Emergency response
- **Medium burn** (> 25% in 6 hours): Investigate and mitigate
- **Slow burn** (steady consumption): Monitor and optimize

### Budget Actions
```yaml
Budget Remaining > 50%:
  - Normal development velocity
  - Deploy new features
  - Conduct experiments

Budget Remaining 10-50%:
  - Focus on reliability
  - Reduce deployment frequency
  - Prioritize bug fixes

Budget Remaining < 10%:
  - Freeze non-critical changes
  - All-hands reliability focus
  - Defer feature releases
```

## SLO Review Process

### Weekly Reviews
- SLO performance vs targets
- Error budget consumption
- Trend analysis
- Action item progress

### Monthly Reviews
- SLO target evaluation
- Budget policy effectiveness
- Customer impact assessment
- Process improvements

### Quarterly Reviews
- SLO target adjustments
- New SLO identification
- Tool and process evolution
- Stakeholder feedback

## Incident Impact on SLOs

### Severity Classification
```yaml
SEV-1 (Critical):
  - Complete service outage
  - Significant SLO impact
  - Immediate escalation

SEV-2 (Major):
  - Partial service degradation
  - SLO at risk
  - Business hours escalation

SEV-3 (Minor):
  - Minimal user impact
  - SLO buffer consumption
  - Standard response
```

### Post-Incident SLO Analysis
1. Calculate SLO impact duration
2. Assess error budget consumption
3. Evaluate alerting effectiveness
4. Update SLOs if needed

## SLA Commitments

### Customer-Facing SLAs
Based on SLOs with additional buffer:

**Service Availability**: 99.5% uptime
- Credits: 10% monthly fee if < 99.5%
- Credits: 25% monthly fee if < 99%

**Response Time**: P95 < 1 second
- Performance reports available monthly
- No penalties, but reputation impact

### Internal SLAs
**Support Response Times**:
- Critical issues: 1 hour
- Major issues: 4 hours  
- Minor issues: 24 hours

## Continuous Improvement

### SLO Evolution
- Start with loose SLOs, tighten over time
- Add new SLOs as system matures
- Remove SLOs that don't drive value

### Automation
- Automated SLO reporting
- Error budget alerts
- Policy enforcement
- Trend analysis

### Culture & Training
- SLO awareness training
- Incident response training
- Error budget decision making
- Customer empathy building

## Tools & Implementation

### Code Examples
```python
# SLO measurement example
def calculate_availability_slo(start_time, end_time):
    total_requests = get_request_count(start_time, end_time)
    successful_requests = get_successful_requests(start_time, end_time)
    
    availability = (successful_requests / total_requests) * 100
    slo_target = 99.9
    
    return {
        'availability': availability,
        'slo_met': availability >= slo_target,
        'error_budget_consumed': (100 - availability) / (100 - slo_target)
    }
```
