# ADR-001: Core Technology Stack

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: {{ generated_at }}  
**Deciders**: Development Team  

## Context

We need to select a technology stack for {{ meta.name }} that will:
- Support the business requirements
- Scale with user growth
- Enable rapid development
- Ensure maintainability

### Business Requirements
{% if problem.statement %}
{{ problem.statement }}
{% endif %}

### Technical Constraints
{% if constraints.technical %}
- Architecture: {{ constraints.technical.architecture if constraints.technical.architecture else 'Microservices/Monolith TBD' }}
- Infrastructure: {{ constraints.technical.infrastructure if constraints.technical.infrastructure else 'Cloud-native preferred' }}
- Performance: {{ constraints.technical.performance if constraints.technical.performance else 'Sub-second response times' }}
{% else %}
- Scalability: Must handle 10,000+ concurrent users
- Performance: Sub-second response times
- Availability: 99.9% uptime requirement
- Security: Enterprise-grade security controls
{% endif %}

## Decision

We will use the following technology stack:

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with component library
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library

### Backend
- **Runtime**: Node.js 18 LTS
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15
- **Cache**: Redis 7
- **Message Queue**: AWS SQS / RabbitMQ

### Infrastructure
- **Cloud Provider**: AWS / Azure / GCP
- **Containers**: Docker + Kubernetes
- **Monitoring**: DataDog / New Relic
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions / GitLab CI

## Rationale

### Why React + TypeScript
- **Team Expertise**: Team has strong React experience
- **Ecosystem**: Rich ecosystem with extensive libraries
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript provides compile-time error catching
- **Community**: Large community and extensive documentation

### Why Node.js + Express
- **Consistency**: Same language (JS/TS) across frontend and backend
- **Performance**: Event-driven architecture suitable for I/O operations
- **Ecosystem**: NPM ecosystem provides extensive package availability
- **Rapid Development**: Quick prototyping and development cycles

### Why PostgreSQL
- **ACID Compliance**: Strong consistency guarantees
- **JSON Support**: Native JSON operations for flexible schemas
- **Scalability**: Proven scalability with proper optimization
- **Community**: Mature ecosystem with excellent tooling

## Consequences

### Positive
- Faster development with shared language/skillset
- Strong typing reduces runtime errors
- Mature ecosystem reduces development time
- Good scalability characteristics

### Negative
- Node.js single-threaded nature may limit CPU-intensive tasks
- JavaScript ecosystem can be volatile with frequent updates
- PostgreSQL may require additional expertise for optimization
- Cloud infrastructure costs may scale with usage

### Mitigations
- Use worker threads for CPU-intensive operations
- Pin dependency versions and use security scanning
- Invest in database performance training
- Implement cost monitoring and optimization

## Next Steps
1. Set up development environment with chosen stack
2. Create project scaffolding and basic structure
3. Implement authentication and basic CRUD operations
4. Set up monitoring and observability tools
5. Document coding standards and best practices

# ADR-002: Data Architecture

**Status**: Proposed  
**Date**: {{ generated_at }}  
**Deciders**: Data Team, Development Team  

## Context

We need to design a data architecture that supports:
{% if constraints.data %}
{{ constraints.data }}
{% else %}
- Transactional consistency for critical operations
- Analytics and reporting capabilities
- User data privacy and security
- Scalable data processing
{% endif %}

## Decision

[To be filled when actual decision is made]

### Proposed Architecture
1. **Operational Database**: PostgreSQL for transactional data
2. **Analytics Database**: Data warehouse (Snowflake/BigQuery/Redshift)
3. **Caching Layer**: Redis for session and frequently accessed data
4. **Event Streaming**: Apache Kafka for real-time data processing
5. **Object Storage**: S3-compatible storage for files and backups

## Rationale

[To be completed during decision process]

## Consequences

# ADR-003: Security Architecture

**Status**: Proposed  
**Date**: {{ generated_at }}  
**Deciders**: Security Team, Development Team  

## Context

Security requirements for {{ meta.name }}:

{% if constraints.security %}
{{ constraints.security }}
{% else %}
- User authentication and authorization
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Audit logging and compliance
- Threat detection and response
{% endif %}

## Decision

[To be decided]

### Proposed Security Controls
1. **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect
2. **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
3. **Encryption**: AES-256 for data at rest, TLS 1.3 for transit
4. **Secrets Management**: HashiCorp Vault / AWS Secrets Manager
5. **Monitoring**: SIEM integration for security events

- Versioning strategy
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Documentation and discoverability

## Decision

[To be decided]

### Proposed API Strategy
1. **Primary Protocol**: REST with OpenAPI 3.0 specification
2. **Versioning**: URL path versioning (e.g., /v1/users)
3. **Authentication**: JWT tokens with short expiry
4. **Rate Limiting**: Token bucket algorithm
5. **Documentation**: Swagger UI with interactive examples
